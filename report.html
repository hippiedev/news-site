    <h1>Oluwapeluwa Alexander Ibrahim</h1>

    <p class="introduction">
        I created a newspaper/article site with the aim of incorporating a retro-newspaper vibe with a mordern approach. I wanted it to be a merger of the old and new. I also aimed to achieve minimalism. Basically, something that looks simple and retro, but is efficient (like something modern). This approach led me to implement an in-article routing to the other articles (no archives page). This also influenced my decision to call it "The News"

        <p class="question">State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</p>
        <p class="answer"><ul>
            <li>The Wall Street Journal user interface (hence my decision for the font faces)</li>
            <li>Newspapers</li>
            <li>Kanye West (colors and background music)</li>

        <p class="question">State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</p>
        <p class="answer"><ul>
            <li>Through the keyboard. By pressing the tab button, you can easily navigate to links and buttons and interact with them</li>
            <li>Audio. I added audio to page 2, and page 4 includes audio-video</li>
            <li>Font size adjustments for users with impaired vision</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="question">State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site.</p>
        <p class="answer"><ul>
            <li>I considered usability for users with impaired vision</li>
            <li>I considered usability for users that wants to quickly run through a couple of articles by including other articles at the side</li>
            <li>I considered usability for users with impaired hearing</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="question">State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
            how you did that </p>
        <p class="answer"><ul>
            <li>I realised the importance of semantic HTML in user accessibility. I initially started off with mostly div tags, when pressing the tab button to inspect accessibility through the keyboard, I noticed the div elements weren't being focused on for interactions, until I changed them to their semantic counterparts</li>
            <li>I learnt that it's best not to add the "aria-role" attribute excessively. It is best to just use the proper HTML tags.</li>
            <li>I learnt that the JavaScript querySelector function is most convenient for selecting HTML for DOM manipulations because its paramters are similar to css selectors</li>
        </ul></p>

        <p class="question">What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I think the font size adjustment was a nice touch.

        <p class="question">What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
            another time?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            I think I can improve the user interface a bit more. I think the font I used for paragraph texts isn't so readable because it's very light. So next time, I could explore a different combination of fonts.
