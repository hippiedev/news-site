          The US targeted an aid worker with a drone strike in Kabul, mistakenly
          believe he was an ISIS-K militant preparing for a terror attack,
          according to a New York Times report . In the process, the August 29
          strike killed 10 Afghan civilians, including seven children. The aid
          worker, Zemari Ahmadi, was also killed by the 20-pound Hellfire
          missile fired at his car, per the report. The US military framed the
          threat posed by the car as imminent, and defended the drone attack as
          a "righteous strike." Officials said the military believed the car was
          being packed with explosives for an attack. But footage obtained by
          The New York Times suggests Ahmadi was actually loading the car with
          water containers for his home. The Pentagon did not immediately
          respond to Insider's request for comment. -Evan Hill (@evanhill)
          September 10, 2021 The August 29 strike was carried out as the US was
          wrapping up the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and a chaotic
          evacuation process. It came after an ISIS-K attack near the Kabul
          airport killed 13 US service members and 169 Afghan civilians. There
          were concerns that ISIS-K would carry out another attack before the
          evacuation was complete. President Joe Biden has signaled that though
          the US no longer has boots on the ground in Afghanistan, it will
          continue to target ISIS-K in the country via drone strikes and other
          means. The use of drones in counterterrorism operations has
          consistently been among the most controversial aspects of America's
          global war on terror, particularly due to their association with
          civilian casualties . It's estimated between 4,126 to 10,076 people
          have been killed by US drone strikes in Afghanistan since January
          2004, including between 300 to 909 civilians, according to the Bureau
          of Investigative Journalism , a UK-based organization that has tracked
          US drone strikes for years.
