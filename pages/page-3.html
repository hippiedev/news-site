          Swarms of small satellites could communicate amongst themselves to
          collect data on important weather patterns at different times of the
          day or year, and from multiple angles. Such swarms, using machine
          learning algorithms, could revolutionize scientists’ understanding of
          weather and climate changes. Engineer Sabrina Thompson is working on
          software to enable small spacecraft, or SmallSats, to communicate with
          each other, identify high-value observation targets, and coordinate
          attitude and timing to get different views of the same target. “We
          already know that Saharan dust blowing over to the Amazon rainforests
          affects cloud formation over the Atlantic Ocean during certain times
          of the year,” said Thompson, who works at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight
          Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “How do you capture that cloud
          formation? How do you tell a swarm of satellites what region and time
          of day is the best to observe that phenomenon?”

          Under Thompson’s plan, scientists would establish a set of
          requirements for observations and define high-value targets. Then the
          software would take over, enabling a spacecraft swarm to figure out
          how to move relative to one another to best observe these targets.
          Strategies might also change based on time of day, season, or the
          region being observed. The spacecraft also would use onboard machine
          learning to improve viewing strategies over time. “There are several
          types of swarm configuration being considered,” Thompson said. “One
          might be a swarm where satellites will be in different orbits, which
          will allow them to view a cloud or other phenomenon at different
          angles. Another swarm could view the same phenomena with similar view,
          but at different times of the day. A third type of swarm might combine
          both, with some satellites in the same orbit, following one another
          with some time offset, and other satellites which may be in orbits
          with different altitudes and/or inclinations.”

            with more narrow-angle, high-resolution polarimeters, could
            potentially revolutionize understanding of weather formation and
            processes. Credit: NASA/SDL/Jose Vanderlei Martins
          </p>

          While a swarm would stay within the same orbit, individual spacecraft
          could even use something called differential drag control —
          manipulating the forces caused by Earth’s atmosphere dragging against
          the orbiting craft — to control the time separation between each
          spacecraft relative to others in the swarm, she said. “The length of
          time it takes to perform a differential drag maneuver depends on the
          spacecraft mass and area, as well as the orbital altitude. For
          instance, it can take as long as one year or as short as a couple of
          days, even hours.” “With multiple spacecraft in one formation to view
          the same target,” Thompson said, “you can see a cloud, for instance,
          not just from the top, but from the sides as well.” In a different
          formation, you can see that cloud at different stages of its
          life-cycle from multiple SmallSats passing at different times.
