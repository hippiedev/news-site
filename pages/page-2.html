          Good evening, I'm Jed West and this is the six o'clock news.
          Headlines..<br /><br />

          London has won the race to host the Olympics in 2012. Estonia has
          elected a new president. Hurricanes Maxwell and Nelly have struck the
          east coast of America, in particular the Florida Keys. Thousands
          injured. Manchester United have signed the prodigious young talent,
          Brillinho, from Sao Paolo for a record €42 million. Chi Chi the panda
          has given birth to twins in Berlin zoo. Officials announced early this
          morning from Singapore that London beat Paris in the race to host the
          2012 Olympics. Many people had expected Paris to be the city honoured
          with the Olympics, but in a surprise twist London, following the
          eliminations of New York, Moscow and Madrid, emerged as victors.
          Spokesman Georgia Smith said "It's a great day for London, for England
          and the United Kingdom. We will make this an Olympics never to be
          forgotten" Polling stations in Estonia closed just a few hours ago,
          but it seems clear that Vladimir Shevchenko has already secured enough
          votes to become the new president. His election campaign was very
          controversial in that he promised to privatise all Estonian industry
          and use the money raised to invest in schools and hospitals. Exit
          polls indicate Mr Shevchenko took almost 72% of the vote. He is
          currently preparing his acceptance speech and is expected to assume
          power in the next 48 hours. Once again the south east coast of America
          and the Caribbean are suffering the effects of hurricanes. The latest
          two to hit are Maxwell and Nelly, and yesterday wind speeds of up to
          180kph were recorded, causing millions of dollars of damage to homes,
          roads and ports. The US government has issued an evacuation order and
          since yesterday evening the freeways have been jammed with worried
          residents looking to escape from the hurricanes. Sport, and the
          world's richest football club, Manchester United, yesterday signed
          young Brazilian star, Brillinho, for a world record €42 million. The
          player, only just 18 years old, signed a 5-year contract in the
          Manchester United boardroom in front of the world's cameras and
          microphones. Speaking through an interpreter he said he was very
          excited to be playing in the UK but would miss the sun and above all
          the beaches of Rio De Janeiro. Finally, good news at last for the
          endangered panda. This morning, just before 10.00am CET, Chi Chi the
          Giant Chinese panda gave birth to twins, a male and a female, in
          Berlin zoo. Chi Chi, who has been in captivity since 1994, is said to
          be well and clearly happy to have finally become a mother. And that
          was the six o'clock news. Join me at seven for the latest headlines.
          I'm Jed West and thank you for listening to Radio 105.
