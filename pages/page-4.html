          Kanye West has unveiled the dramatic visuals for “Come to Life.” The
          video clip was filmed during the rapper’s August 26th listening event
          streamed on Apple Music. “Come to Life” sees West set himself on fire
          and reunite with Kim Kardashian in a Balenciaga wedding gown.

          Just hours before the album dropped on streaming services, West took to
          Instagram to claim the album was being held up by DaBaby's manager, who
          refused to clear a verse on the song "Jail." "Jail Pt. 2" is not,
          however, available on streaming services, suggesting that the issue has
          not been resolved. Original Post (August 6): Since his first DONDA
          listening party earlier this month, Kanye West has been living inside
          the Mercedes-Benz Arena to finish up the album, and last night the
          rapper revealed the finished album through another performance. Leading
          up to the listening party, Kanye was livestreaming from inside his room
          at the stadium, where viewers got to see the rapper interact with
          friends, doing push-ups and lifting weights, and bizarrely, going to
          sleep. A pre-order for the album also surfaced on Apple Music prior to
          the event, revealing that DONDA features a total of 24 tracks alongside
          an August 7 release date.
