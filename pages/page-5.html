          Earlier this year, Tesla's Chinese venture looked imperiled by
          political opposition to the company from China's ruling party.
          Beijing's suspicions led to bans being enacted in May blocking Teslas
          from entering military bases and other official facilities. The
          government was apparently concerned about data collection through the
          vehicles' cameras, sensors, and GPS devices. New regulations are set
          to go into effect on Oct. 1 in an effort to improve "data security" on
          Internet-connected vehicles, including Teslas.

          <br />

          Passenger vehicle sales in China also contracted sharply during
          August, according to research by the CPCA. The association says
          passenger vehicle sales inched downward 3.3% from July and plunged
          14.7% year over year. This followed a 6.2% year-over-year drop in July
          and a 6.5% fall in June 2021. Sales have now been slumping for more
          than a quarter. However, defying the double whammy of state suspicion
          and declining consumer demand, Tesla sold 12,885 electric vehicles
          made in China within that country's borders during August. This is a
          49.4% increase from July's sales, signaling Tesla's strategy of
          cutting its Chinese market prices may be working. In late July, the
          company pared about 5.3% off the price of its Model 3 sedan, and is
          also accepting Chinese pre-orders for an affordable variant of the
          Model Y SUV. Both vehicles qualify for subsidies under Chinese law,
          lowering their de facto prices even further.
